    Introduction to Computer Science
    
    Computer Science is the study of computational systems and the design of computer systems and their applications. It encompasses both the theoretical study of algorithms and the practical problems of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.
    
    History of Computer Science:
    - Early mechanical calculators (1600s)
    - Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1830s)
    - Alan Turing's theoretical work (1930s-1940s)
    - First electronic computers (1940s)
    - Personal computers (1970s-1980s)
    - Internet and World Wide Web (1990s)
    - Mobile computing and cloud computing (2000s)
    
    Key Areas of Computer Science:
    1. Algorithms and Data Structures
    2. Programming Languages
    3. Computer Systems and Architecture
    4. Software Engineering
    5. Database Systems
    6. Computer Networks
    7. Artificial Intelligence
    8. Human-Computer Interaction
    
    Algorithms:
    An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used in every aspect of computing.
    
    Types of Algorithms:
    - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort)
    - Search algorithms (linear search, binary search)
    - Graph algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree)
    - Dynamic programming algorithms
    
    Applications of Computer Science:
    - Web development and e-commerce
    - Mobile applications
    - Video games and entertainment
    - Scientific computing and research
    - Healthcare and medical systems
    - Financial systems and banking
    - Transportation and logistics
    - Education and e-learning
